"""Tests for CredentialVault – security hotfix verification.

Audit finding #4: the vault previously used a static hardcoded salt
(b"sky_claw_static_salt_for_vault").  These tests verify that:
  1. A dynamic, cryptographically-secure salt is generated via os.urandom.
  2. Two independent vault instances derive *different* keys from the same
     master_key (because different salts produce different key material).
  3. Vault initialisation fails loudly (RuntimeError + CRITICAL log) when
     salt generation is impossible, instead of silently falling back to a
     weak deterministic value.
