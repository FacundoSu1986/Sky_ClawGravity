"""Cross-platform file permission enforcement.

On Windows, uses icacls to restrict file access to the current user
AND post-validates the effective DACL.  On POSIX, uses os.chmod with
restrictive permissions.

**Windows** is fail-closed: if the DACL cannot be verified as owner-only
after hardening, the file artifact is destroyed (unlinked) and a
``PermissionError`` is raised.  Directories are never recursively deleted —
callers handle higher-level cleanup.

**POSIX** raises ``PermissionError`` on ``os.chmod`` failure but does *not*
unlink the file — the chmod failure itself indicates a permission problem on
the filesystem, not a leaked secret.
